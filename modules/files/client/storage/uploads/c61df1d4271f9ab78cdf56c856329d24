    Today, I tried to setup the mobile and node app.

There is a version issue while setting it up... unable to solve same.
So need proper steps to setup and what versions of node,mongo are being used in app.

Secondly, there is a cross origin issue while setting mobile cordova app, will try and test this on ios device tomorrow. But here i did read the code and its just a web app using web services over http with Node backend.
So finally, node app needs to be optimised.. for JSON-LD conversion of schema.

Also checked the backend code, and didn't found any JSON-LD schema being used,
May be client wants that to be converted from regular JSON schema to JSON-LD schema.

Did some R&D over the internet for JSON-LD
